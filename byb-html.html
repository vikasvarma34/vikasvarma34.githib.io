<h1>WELCOME TO BYB </h1>
            </header>
           <div> It all began in California, where our founder, Shant Mardirosian grew up. He had always revered a fresh, classic old-fashioned burger but finding one was becoming increasingly rare in a world of apparent burger defilement. Frozen patties. Over-seasoned and compromised beef quality. Order speed over a burger-eating experience that was fresh and perfect every time. And so the mission began, whether he knew it at the time or not.

            Fast forward years later, he found himself in Toronto attending Seminary school with plans of becoming a priest. But something didn’t feel quite right. He hoped that his true calling would reveal itself.
            
            Lucky for us (and burger lovers writ large) it finally did. A giant leap of faith was taken and shortly thereafter, The Burger’s Priest was conceived.
            
            You could call it divine inspiration in service of burger redemption.</div>
